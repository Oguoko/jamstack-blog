Mending Minds Foundation approached me with the idea of creating a digital platform web design and brand identity that identifies their services as mental health providers. 


The challenges overcomed in this project includes the client changing the name of the project/foundation from Kenya Mental Health First Aid to the current, much simpler, Mending Minds.


I created the logo and web design of the same. 


Below is the initial design and the final design which was subsequently uploaded.
